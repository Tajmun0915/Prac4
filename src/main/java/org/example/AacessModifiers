Java provides four types of access modifiers :
Public: The member is accessible from any other class.
Private: The member is accessible only within the class it is declared.
Protected: The member is accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
Default (Package-Private): If no access modifier is specified, the member is accessible only within the same package.


Scope of Access Modifiers :
Public: Accessible from any class in any package.
Private: Accessible only within the class it is defined.
Protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses (including those in different packages).
Default (Package-Private): Accessible only within the same package.
