Singleton Pattern:
 Ensures a class has only one instance, providing a global point of access.
 Beneficial for scenarios where a single object is needed for coordination (e.g., configuration settings).

Factory Pattern:
 Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to determine the object type.
 Useful for creating objects when the exact type is determined at runtime.

Builder Pattern:
 Separates object construction from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
 Ideal for constructing complex objects with multiple configurations.
